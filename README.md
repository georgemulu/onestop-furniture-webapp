Onestop Web Development Project

During our web development course, our team embarked on an ambitious group project that involved designing and building an e-commerce website. We named our project "Onestop Furniture," reflecting its mission to serve as a one-stop shop for purchasing furniture online.

The primary goal of Onestop Furniture was to create a user-friendly, visually appealing, and functional website where customers could browse and buy a wide range of furniture items. We started with brainstorming and planning sessions, defining the scope of the project and identifying the key features we wanted to include, such as:

1. Product Catalog: An organized and easily navigable catalog showcasing various categories of furniture, including living room, bedroom, office, and outdoor furniture.
2. Search and Filter: Advanced search and filter options to help users quickly find the furniture items they were looking for based on criteria such as price, color, material, and size.
3. Product Pages: Detailed product pages for each furniture item, featuring high-quality images, descriptions, specifications, and customer reviews.
4. Shopping Cart and Checkout: A secure and efficient shopping cart and checkout system, allowing users to review their selected items, apply discount codes, and complete their purchases with multiple payment options.
5. User Accounts: User account functionality, enabling customers to create profiles, track their orders, save wishlists, and manage their personal information.
6. Responsive Design: A responsive design that ensured the website was accessible and visually appealing on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Throughout the project, we collaborated closely, leveraging our individual skills and strengths in front-end and back-end development, design, and user experience. We utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MariaDB

The Onestop Furniture project not only allowed us to apply the knowledge and skills we acquired during our studies but also provided us with valuable experience in teamwork, problem-solving, and project management.
